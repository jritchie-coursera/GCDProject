#UCI HAR Tidy Dataset

This dataset (tidy.csv) is derived from the data set found at
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The test and training data have been merged into one data set.  The measured and frequencyDomain readings from the devices have been averaged on a subject + activity basis.
From the original data set time domain variables were prefixed with a t and frequency domain variables were prefixed with an f

The variables found in the dataset are listed below.
